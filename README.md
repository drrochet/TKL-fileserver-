Questions regarding TKL fileserver install

I am trying to install TKL fileserver using a bootable usb (made from the iso).  The installation looks o move forward like normal until it gets to installing the grub bootloader.  While that is being installed I get a "grub-install /dev/sda failed.  this is a fatal error".  

Afterwards the computer reboots and seems to stop just before loading the OS.  

I don't know how to produce a log file of the install to share (as I am a preemie newb with linux).  ANy ideas?
